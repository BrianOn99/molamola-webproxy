error are printed to stderr directly, while other messages are logged through
syslog().  If you use systemd, `journalctl -b` will show you the messages.

== Coding Convention

* Follow the Unix convention:
** For function which DO something, return 0 in success
** For function which TEST something, such as `isodd(num)`, return 1 on success
* Avoid unnecessary typedef
