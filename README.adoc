= molamola-web-proxy, a http proxy which slows down your http service

[WARNING]
====
* It works, but there are quite a lot of bugs.  They will *NEVER* be fixed.
* It is intended for reference only (to see how HTTP works).  *Don't* use it.
* This is an CUHK CS assignment.  *NOT* for secure usage.

== Debug

error are printed to stderr directly, while other messages are logged through
syslog().  If you use systemd, `journalctl -b` will show you the messages.

Some tools that I always open when I write code  which you may find useful:

* use `telnet 127.0.0.1 [your port]` to hand-craft a http request.
* firefox proxy + wireshark listening to Loopback

== Coding Convention

* Follow the Unix convention:
** For function which DO something, return 0 in success, -1 on failure
** For function which TEST something, such as `isodd(num)`, return 1 on success
* Avoid unnecessary typedef
